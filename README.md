# Popping-the-filter-bubble

With the increasing popularity of microblogging sites, we
are in the era of information explosion. Although Twitter
provides a list of most popular topics people tweet about
known as Trending Topics, it is often hard to understand
what these trending topics are about and what different
opinions do people have about a particular topic. Since the
number of tweets associated with a trending topic could be
large, users generally get to see some selected tweets which
is filtered through a mechanism where user select who to
follow, and only see what they share. This Filter Bubble[6]
undermine the marketplace of ideas and damage the ability
to accurately predict events in the world. If user is never
exposed to opinions or arguments that challenge his point
of view, he will never question it or evolve it.
We propose a solution to the problem by providing the
user a wider/global view of a particular trending event through
exposing him to the available opinions world-wide. We evaluate existing techniques for encoding tweets into appropriate
vector representations and discuss the pros and cons.
The dataset consists of tweets from Web Summit 2015 1
,
US presidential election 2012 2
and the FA cup 3
